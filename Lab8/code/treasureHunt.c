/* A good first step would be to read the value of the
initial block and print it. Then a good second step would
be to read the second block and print its value. Now think
about adding the counter argument to the callback (thatâ€™s
what arg is for) and counting down. Finally,
be sure that you only print the value of the
last block and that your program terminates when its done.

Note that, unlike the asynchronous read code above,
in this case the main thread uses an infinite loop to keep
it from leaving once the first request has been sent.
It is your responsibility to then exit the program once you
have identified that all required tasks have completed.
You may do that by one of the following ways:

Call exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); once the program has completed all its tasks; or
Create a variable that is modified once all tasks are completed, and change the main function's final loop to a polling loop that checks this variable.
