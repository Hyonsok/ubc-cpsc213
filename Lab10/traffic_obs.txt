In traffic_sem.c, times with car going to the direction more densed,compared to traffic.c
For example, in the result of traffic_sem.c, 
Times with 1 car going north: 357
Times with 1 car going north: 333
Times with 1 car going north: 310
Times with 1 car going south: 357
Times with 1 car going south: 334
Times with 1 car going south: 310

In the result of traffic.c

Times with 1 car going north: 226
Times with 1 car going north: 402
Times with 1 car going north: 332
Times with 1 car going south: 227
Times with 1 car going south: 398
Times with 1 car going south: 357

I have requirements that a given resource can be used by N different threads concurrently at the same time.
A shared semaphore initialized to N will do the job.
However, a mutex will not be sufficient since it allows at most 1 thread to execute the critical section at any given time.
That is why the above results are given.
